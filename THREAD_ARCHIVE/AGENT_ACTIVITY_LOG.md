# Agent Activity Log

Compact ongoing activity log for multi-agent I.C.E. work.

Actor labels:
- `gpt` = PC/browser GPT orchestration lane
- `mgpt` = mobile GPT orchestration lane
- `pcdx` = PC/desktop Codex implementation lane
- `mcdx` = mobile/web Codex implementation lane

Entry format:

```text

Keep this file concise. Use `PROJECT_LOG.md` for milestone summaries and `PROJECT_STATE.md` for current operational truth.
